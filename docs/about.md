# About Biopet


## The Philosophy

Biopet is meant to be the core framework for data analysis pipelines developed
by SASC (and collaborators). It consists of wrappers of common command-line tools,
some production-level data analysis pipelines, and some custom command-line tools
that we develop in-house.

Pipelines developed using the Biopet framework are meant to be flexible, allowing
users to modify the actual command line flags of the tools within to suit their
need.
