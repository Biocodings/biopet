# Introduction
Within the LUMC we have a compute cluster which runs on the Sun Grid Engine (SGE). The cluster has around 600 cores now and multiple terabytes of memory.
The SGE enables the cluster to schedule all the jobs coming from different users in a fair way. So Resources are shared equally between multiple users.
