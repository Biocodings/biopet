# Introduction

Within the LUMC we have a compute cluster which runs on the Sun Grid Engine (SGE). This cluster currently consists of around 600 
cores and several terabytes of memory. The Sun Grid Engine (SGE) enables the cluster to schedule all the jobs coming from 
different users in a fair way. So Resources are shared equally between multiple users.

# Sun Grid Engine

Oracle Grid Engine or Sun Grid Engine is a computer cluster software system also known as a batch-queing system. These
 systems help the computer cluster users to distribute and fairly schedule the jobs to the different computers in the cluster.

# Open Grid Engine

The Open Grid Engine (OGE) is based on the SunGridEngine but is completely open source. It does support commercially batch-queuing
 systems.
