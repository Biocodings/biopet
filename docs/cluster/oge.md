# Introduction
Within the LUMC we have a compute cluster which runs on the Sun Grid Engine (SGE). This cluster currently consists of around 600 
cores and several terabytes of memory. The Sun Grid Engine (SGE) enables the cluster to schedule all the jobs coming from 
different users in a fair way. So Resources are shared equally between multiple users.
