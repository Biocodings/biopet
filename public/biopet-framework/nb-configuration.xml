    Biopet is built on top of GATK Queue for building bioinformatic
    pipelines. It is mainly intended to support LUMC SHARK cluster which is running
    SGE. But other types of HPC that are supported by GATK Queue (such as PBS)
    should also be able to execute Biopet tools and pipelines.

Properties that influence various parts of the IDE, especially code formatting and the like. 
You can copy and paste the single properties, into the pom.xml file and the IDE will pick them up.
That way multiple projects can share the same settings (useful for formatting rules for example).
Any value defined here will override the pom.xml file value but is only applicable to the current project.
